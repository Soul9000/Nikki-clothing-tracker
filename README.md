This is a basic list maker for writing down clothes that you have collected or you can use it for names of the items used in custom sets

i also added a import and export function. it will export as .nct and save to your computer. make sure you keep track of where it is.
i suggest you make a folder for the files!

this is very basic so if you want you can edit it and make it better. Im new to github so let me know what you change

if you find any issues feel free to correct them

thanks for looking at this
